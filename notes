Garnet

An attempt to create a protoype/starter application device combination for an Internet of Things device.
This device should take readings from ananlog sensors and record them remotely.
This device should be able to offer a form of controling it.
The user of the device should be able to get information about the device remotely
Create a protoype board and application that can be used to configure proof of concept designs for other boards.

In many ways this is just a computer that is set up in a certain way.
I am using the Intel Edison board because I received it, free of charge at a hackathon.
Data from the analog inputs is stored in a database. Values from this database are retreived then sent to a remote storage system.


Some of The Main Pieces

Linux, Ubilinux, Node, JavaScript,
mraa, sqlite3,
pm2 maintain long running processes
promises, ReactiveX, React

Development

Develop on a regular laptop the IOT application, then transfer the application to an IOT device with minimal effort.


The Current Setup:

Edison chip, Arduino board, 2 bread boards, power banks


Server

The IOT device serves up a web site that will display information about the device or what it is monitoring.
This website will offer controls that will enable change of the componets connected to its bread boards.
